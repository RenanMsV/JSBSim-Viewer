# JSBSim Viewer

JSBSim-Viewer is an extension that lets you import and visualize the spatial layout of [JSBSim](https://github.com/JSBSim-Team/jsbsim) flight dynamics model (FDM) XML data. It reads the XML structure and plots the defined nodes, points, and reference locations in 3D space, allowing you to explore the aircraftâ€™s configuration visually.

This is useful for:

- Inspecting the geometric and reference layout of JSBSim aircraft models
- Debugging or understanding FDM XML configurations
- Visualizing how aerodynamic and structural points are positioned relative to each other
